### **Step 1: Open Log Monitor**

**Open a NEW terminal** and run:
```bash
cd /Users/mohammadmahmudulislam/Desktop/erp-ai-microservices
docker-compose logs -f sales-service inventory-service | grep -i "stock\|inventory\|fulfill\|updating"
```

Keep this terminal open to watch the stock reduction happen in real-time!

### **Step 2: Create Order in Frontend**

1. **Go to your ERP frontend** (http://localhost:5173 or wherever it's running)
2. **Navigate to**: Sales → Orders → Create New Order
3. **Fill in**:
   - Customer: Select any customer
   - Product: Select **"Premium Ballpoint Pen Set"** (PENS001)
   - Quantity: **5**
4. **Click "Create Order"**

---

### **Step 3: Process Payment (Optional)**

If payment screen appears:
1. Select payment method: **Cash**
2. Amount tendered: **125.00** (or more)
3. Click **"Process Payment"**

---

### **Step 4: Confirm Order ⭐ (THIS REDUCES STOCK!)**

1. **Find the "Confirm" button** or **Change status to "Confirmed"**
2. **Click it!**

**Watch your log terminal** - You should see:

```
sales-service  | 🔄 Order XXX being confirmed - will reduce inventory
sales-service  | 🔄 Fulfilling stock for order XXX with 1 items
sales-service  | Fulfilling stock for product 68d08c3fed804d3d1e5a2eaf, quantity 5

inventory-service | 🔍 No warehouse specified, searching for product...
inventory-service | ✅ Found inventory in warehouse ... with 125 available
inventory-service | 📦 Updating inventory table: oldQuantity: 125, newQuantity: 120
inventory-service | ✅ Inventory table updated: new quantity: 120
inventory-service | 🔄 Now updating products table...
inventory-service | ✅ Product table updated successfully
```

---

### **Step 5: Verify Stock Reduced**

**In another terminal**, run:
```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:8002/inventory/verify/68d08c3fed804d3d1e5a2eaf' | jq '{
  product: .product.name,
  before: 200,
  after: .totalInventory.totalQuantity,
  reduced: (200 - .totalInventory.totalQuantity),
  message: .message
}'
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "product": "Premium Ballpoint Pen Set",
  "before": 200,
  "after": 195,
  "reduced": 5,
  "message": "✅ Product and inventory data are consistent!"
}
```

---

## 🔍 Alternative: Check in Database

### Check Inventory Record:
```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:8002/inventory/product/68d08c3fed804d3d1e5a2eaf' | jq '.[] | {warehouse: .warehouseId.name, quantity: .quantity}'
```

**Before**: Should show warehouse with 125
**After**: Should show warehouse with 120

### Check Product:
```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:8002/products/68d08c3fed804d3d1e5a2eaf' | jq '{name, totalQuantity, availableQuantity}'
```

**Before**: totalQuantity: 200 (but it shows 125 due to sync issue - will fix when order confirmed)
**After**: totalQuantity: 195

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

1. ✅ Order status changes to "Confirmed"
