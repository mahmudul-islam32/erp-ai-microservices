## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Backend Fix:
**File:** `sales-service/app/api/v1/payments.py`

**Before (Bug):**
```python
order_number = order.get("order_number", "")  # ❌ Fails if order is Pydantic model
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
order_dict = order if isinstance(order, dict) else order.dict() if hasattr(order, 'dict') else {}
order_number = order_dict.get("order_number", intent_data.order_id)  # ✅ Works with both
```

**Lines Changed:** 2 locations (create-intent and confirm endpoints)  
**Status:** ✅ Applied and restarted

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Browser Cache is the #1 Issue
- Your browser caches JavaScript files
- Old version doesn't have Stripe
- **MUST** hard refresh to see changes
- Try incognito mode if hard refresh doesn't work

### Order Model Bug
- Backend was calling `.get()` on Pydantic model
- ✅ Now fixed to handle both dict and model
- No more 500 errors when creating payment intent
