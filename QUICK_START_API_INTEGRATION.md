## 💡 How It Works

### Data Flow Example (Users):

```
1. User clicks "Users" in sidebar
   ↓
2. UsersPage component mounts
   ↓
3. useEffect dispatches fetchUsers()
   ↓
4. Redux thunk calls usersApi.getAll()
   ↓
5. API client makes GET /api/v1/users/
   ↓
6. Backend returns user data
   ↓
7. Redux updates state.users.users[]
   ↓
8. Component re-renders with data
   ↓
9. Table displays users
```

### Create Flow Example:

```
1. User fills form
   ↓
2. Clicks "Create User"
   ↓
3. Form validates (Zod schema)
   ↓
4. Dispatches createUser(data)
   ↓
5. API call POST /api/v1/users/
   ↓
6. Success → Toast notification
   ↓
7. Redux adds user to state
   ↓
8. Navigate to /dashboard/users
   ↓
9. User sees new entry in list
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No data showing"
1. Check backend services are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify API URLs in docker-compose.yml

### "401 Unauthorized"
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Token might be expired - try logging out and in
3. Check localStorage for access_token

### "Network Error"
1. Check backend service is running
2. Check correct port (8001, 8002, 8003)
3. Check browser network tab (F12)

### "Delete not working"
1. Make sure you click "OK" in confirmation
2. Check user has permission
3. Check backend logs
