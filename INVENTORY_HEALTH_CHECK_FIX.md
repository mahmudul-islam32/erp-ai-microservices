# ✅ Inventory Service Health Check Fix

## 🐛 Problem

**Error during GitHub Actions deployment to EC2:**
```
Container erp-inventory-service  Error
dependency failed to start: container erp-inventory-service is unhealthy
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Root Cause:**
The inventory service Dockerfile used `node:18-alpine` base image, which doesn't include `curl` by default. However, the health check in `docker-compose.prod.yml` was trying to use `curl`, causing the health check to fail and marking the container as unhealthy.

---

## 🔧 Solutions Applied

### 1. Added curl to Inventory Service Dockerfile

**File:** `inventory-service/Dockerfile`

**Change:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install curl for health checks
RUN apk add --no-cache curl

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./
```

**Why:** Alpine Linux uses `apk` package manager. Adding `curl` ensures health checks can run successfully.

### 2. Optimized Health Check Timings

**File:** `docker-compose.prod.yml`

**Changes for inventory-service:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8002/health"]
  interval: 15s      # Was: 30s - Check more frequently
  timeout: 10s       # Unchanged
  retries: 10        # Was: 5 - More retries before failing
  start_period: 90s  # Was: 60s - More time to start
```

**Benefits:**
- **90 seconds** initial grace period for Node.js app to compile and start
- **15 seconds** between health checks (faster to detect when healthy)
- **10 retries** before marking as unhealthy (up to 150 seconds of retries)
- **Total time:** Up to 4 minutes before failing (was 3.5 minutes)

This is especially important for:
- Slower EC2 instances (t2.micro, t2.small)
- MongoDB connection establishment
- NestJS application bootstrap time
- First-time image pulls

## ✅ What Was Verified

### Services with Correct Health Check Tools:

| Service | Base Image | Health Check Tool | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **auth-service** | python:3.11-slim | curl | ✅ Already has curl |
| **sales-service** | python:3.11-slim | curl | ✅ Already has curl |
| **inventory-service** | node:18-alpine | curl | ✅ **FIXED** - Added curl |
| **frontend** | nginx:alpine | wget | ✅ Already has wget |
| **mongodb** | mongo:7.0 | mongosh | ✅ Native tool |
| **redis** | redis:7.2-alpine | redis-cli | ✅ Native tool |

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/mohammadmahmudulislam/Desktop/erp-ai-microservices

# Check what changed
git status

# Add the changes
git add inventory-service/Dockerfile
git add docker-compose.prod.yml

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix: Add curl to inventory-service Dockerfile for health checks"

# Push to trigger GitHub Actions deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Monitor Deployment

**Watch GitHub Actions:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. Watch the latest workflow run

**Expected flow:**
```
✅ Build auth-service
✅ Build inventory-service (with curl now)
✅ Build sales-service
✅ Build frontend
✅ Push images to GitHub Container Registry
✅ SSH to EC2
✅ Pull images
✅ Start containers
✅ Wait for health checks
✅ All services healthy!
✅ Deployment successful
```

### Step 3: Verify on EC2

```bash
# SSH into your EC2 instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_IP

# Navigate to app directory
cd ~/erp

# Check container health status
docker compose ps

# Expected output:
# NAME                    STATUS
# erp-mongodb            Up (healthy)
# erp-redis              Up (healthy)
# erp-auth-service       Up (healthy)
# erp-inventory-service  Up (healthy) ✅ Should be healthy now!
# erp-sales-service      Up (healthy)
# erp-frontend           Up (healthy)

# View real-time logs
docker compose logs -f inventory-service

# Test health endpoint directly
docker compose exec inventory-service curl -f http://localhost:8002/health

# Expected response:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "service": "inventory-service",
#   "version": "1.0.0",
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-16T..."
# }
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If inventory-service is still unhealthy:

#### 1. Check if curl is installed in the container

```bash
docker compose exec inventory-service which curl
# Should output: /usr/bin/curl

docker compose exec inventory-service curl --version
# Should show curl version
```

#### 2. Check if the application is running

```bash
docker compose exec inventory-service ps aux
# Should show: node dist/main.js

docker compose logs inventory-service
# Look for: "🚀 Inventory Service is running on: http://localhost:8002"
```

#### 3. Check MongoDB connection

```bash
# View logs for connection errors
docker compose logs inventory-service | grep -i "mongo\|error\|connection"

# Verify MongoDB is accessible
docker compose exec inventory-service nc -zv mongodb 27017
# Should output: mongodb (172.x.x.x:27017) open
```

#### 4. Test health endpoint manually

```bash
# From inside the container
docker compose exec inventory-service curl -v http://localhost:8002/health

# From EC2 host
curl http://localhost:8002/health
```

#### 5. Check environment variables

```bash
docker compose exec inventory-service env | grep -E "MONGODB|NODE_ENV|PORT|JWT"

# Verify:
# - NODE_ENV=production
# - PORT=8002
# - MONGODB_URI contains correct credentials
# - JWT_SECRET is set
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Container exits immediately

**Check:**
```bash
docker compose logs inventory-service
```

**Possible causes:**
- MongoDB connection failed (check `MONGODB_URI`)
- Missing JWT_SECRET environment variable
- Build errors (check if `dist/main.js` exists)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild the image
docker compose build inventory-service

# Or pull fresh image
docker compose pull inventory-service

# Restart
docker compose up -d inventory-service
```

#### Issue: Health check fails but app runs

**Check:**
```bash
# Is the app listening on the right port?
docker compose exec inventory-service netstat -tlnp | grep 8002

# Can we reach the health endpoint?
docker compose exec inventory-service curl -v http://localhost:8002/health
```

**Possible causes:**
- App not listening on 0.0.0.0 (listening on 127.0.0.1 only)
- Wrong port in environment variable
- Health endpoint not registered

#### Issue: "Connection refused" in health check

**Check:**
```bash
# Is the app fully started?
docker compose logs inventory-service

# Look for: "🚀 Inventory Service is running"
```

**Solution:**
Wait longer or increase `start_period` in docker-compose.prod.yml:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  start_period: 120s  # Give it 2 minutes
```

## 📝 Technical Details

### Why Alpine Linux?

Alpine Linux is used for smaller Docker images:
- **node:18** = ~1GB
- **node:18-alpine** = ~180MB

**Trade-off:** Alpine uses `musl libc` instead of `glibc` and doesn't include many common tools.

### Health Check Mechanism

Docker health checks work as follows:

1. **start_period (90s):** Grace period, failures don't count
2. **After start_period:** Health check runs every `interval` (15s)
3. **If check fails:** Retry up to `retries` times (10 times)
4. **If all retries fail:** Container marked as **unhealthy**
5. **If unhealthy:** Dependent services won't start (sales-service)

### Dependency Chain

```
mongodb (healthy) ──┐
                    ├──> auth-service (healthy) ──┐
                    │                              ├──> inventory-service (healthy) ───> sales-service
                    └──────────────────────────────┘
```

If any service is unhealthy, downstream services fail to start.

## 🎯 Prevention Checklist

To avoid similar issues in the future:

- [x] **Always install health check tools** in Dockerfiles
  - Alpine: `apk add --no-cache curl`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install -y curl`
  
- [x] **Test health checks locally** before deploying
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
  docker compose ps
  ```

- [x] **Use adequate timings** for health checks
  - Start period: 60-90s for backend services
  - Interval: 15-30s
  - Retries: 5-10 times
  
- [x] **Match tools to base images**
  - Alpine → use `wget` (built-in) or install `curl`
  - Debian/Ubuntu → install `curl`
  - Nginx → use `wget` or `curl`

- [x] **Document health endpoints** in code
  ```typescript
  // main.ts
  app.getHttpAdapter().get('/health', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ status: 'healthy' });
  });
  ```
