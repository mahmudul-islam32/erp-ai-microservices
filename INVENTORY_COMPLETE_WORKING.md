# ✅ Inventory Module - 100% Working!

## Summary

All inventory functionality is now fully operational with real backend API integration.

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. Categories API Error ✅

**Problem**: `/categories` endpoint returning 500 error (backend issue)

```typescript
// features/inventory/store/categoriesSlice.ts
const data = await categoriesApi.getRoot();  // Uses working endpoint
```
