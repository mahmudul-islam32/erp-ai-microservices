# DSA Practice & Implementation

This folder contains daily DSA problems with their solutions and real-world implementations in our ERP project.

## Structure
- `problems/` - Daily problem sets with questions and solutions
- `implementations/` - Real-world implementations in the ERP project
- `docs/` - Documentation of where each concept is used

## Learning Approach
1. Solve the problem in Python
2. Implement the concept in the ERP project
3. Document the implementation and its use case
